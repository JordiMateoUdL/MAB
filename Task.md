Regret:

- Add regret

Considerations:
When the slot machines have unknown or stochastic reward distributions, calculating regret requires estimating the expected rewards based on observed outcomes. One common approach for estimating the expected rewards is to use sample averages.

Here's a general outline of how you can calculate regret in the case of unknown or stochastic reward distributions:

Initialize variables:

Set regret to 0.
Set max_expected_reward to the maximum possible reward based on the true rewards of the slot machines.
For each time step t:

Select an arm (slot machine) based on the bandit algorithm's decision-making strategy.
Pull the selected arm and observe the obtained reward.
Update the regret:

Calculate the instantaneous regret at time step t as the difference between max_expected_reward and the observed reward.
Add the instantaneous regret to the cumulative regret.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the desired number of time steps.

Note that estimating the expected rewards based on observed outcomes using sample averages is an approximation and can have some degree of uncertainty. The more pulls you make on each arm, the better your estimation of the expected rewards will be.

By calculating regret in this way, you can measure the missed opportunities or potential improvements in terms of the maximum expected reward, even when the reward distributions of the slot machines are unknown or stochastic.
